Website Design Idea

I want to showcase a game on a webpage.

Homepage: have a trailer of the game with a description and instructions on how to play

Game page: have the game embedded in this webpage and allow comments under the game
           implement a rating system that saves all ratings and creates and average (maybe make it so it doesn't allow spamming as a security feature)

Contact page: email, phone number, and an address

About us page: a small introduction to the team and what inspiredd the game
