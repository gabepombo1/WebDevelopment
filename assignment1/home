            Description:
            <p>
                This game is about a sane Harvester robot named Jank! All his robot buddies have gone Haywire! Including his big boss, Crank. 
                All he can do now is defend himself. Perhaps if he builds himself up, he could eventually face the Mother AI responsible for all of this, and get to the bottom of it.
