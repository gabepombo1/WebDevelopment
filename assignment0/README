Like:
https://www.linkedin.com/feed/: Easy to use inteface, easy access to information you need
Youtube: Clean and well=thought out design, everything you might want is available, even analytical stuff
Steam: Easy to access settings and information, there are good methods of suggesting new titles as well

Dislike:
Facebook: cluttered and full of ads
Reddit: Has a lot of ads and the suggestions at the bottom of a post can confuse your search results
