  - The color scheme should be different because it looks similar to a lot of social media
Youtube: Clean and well=thought out design, everything you might want is available, even analytical stuff
  - There are a lot of ads on this website, which can be annoyign for users, this should change
Steam: Easy to access settings and information, there are good methods of suggesting new titles as well
  - There is a lot of clutter even though there are no ads, this should be changed

Dislike:
Facebook: cluttered and full of ads
  - The style of the website is really boxy, it would look better if it was similar to Twitter
Reddit: Has a lot of ads and the suggestions at the bottom of a post can confuse your search results
  - The suggestions at the bottom of a page shouldn't show up in search results, this should change
